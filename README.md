# QuickCrop
A program that allows quick cropping to content of png files.
(Cropping to content refers to removing of all fully transparent pixel lines surrounding the visible image data.)

This program will crop and overwrite any file whose path was passed to it, but it also offers the option to add a context menu option to png files in explorer.
